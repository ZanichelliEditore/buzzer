# Contributing Guidelines: How to contribute to Buzzer

Do you want to add a new feature or fix an existing bug yourself?
- We use Laravel and its powerful interfaces to ensure easy code readability and manteinance, especially for managing queues.
- Be sure to carefully read the Laravel documentation regarding the technologies used within Buzzer before considering any developments.

## Testing

We believe that comprehensive automatic test coverage is crucial for a project to stay maintainable over time. Before you open a pull request (PR), make sure you've added the necessary tests.

## Opening a Pull Request (PR)

When opening a PR, please follow these guidelines:



Use the id of the issue and a short description of the changes you made. For example, 

- **Title**: "#135 fix message for duplicate subscription to channel".
- **Description**: Explain the changes you made and detail any questions you may have for the maintainers. 

### Do you want to report a bug or propose we implement a new feature?
First of all, search through the Issues tab to make sure that the same bug hasn't already been reported.
If there is no open issue related to your topic, you can open a new one by using one of our templates. Make sure to add a clear title and description, together with as much information as possible. If you're reporting a bug, please include clear steps to reproduce it and, whenever possible, a minimal reproducible example.

### Do you have questions about this project?
